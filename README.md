# ConnectFour

A simple Connect Four game which I hope demonstrates the basics of SwiftUI and Combine beyond a typical list-based application. Through this project, I have learned that the upsides of using SwiftUI outside of an orthodox single view application are tremendous. Viewing this demo you can see in practice the basic of animations and reusing simple components to build more complex custom user interfaces.

At the moment, I do not have the betas installed therefore I could not get a decent screen capture of the gameplay. If anyone reading this wants to record the gameplay and add it to the readme that would be great.
